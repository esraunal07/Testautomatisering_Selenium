Workshop: Selenium + BDD/Cucumber

Overview:
In this one-week workshop, We used Selenium with Cucumber/BDD to test the Espresso Addict game through black-box testing, focusing on browser-based interactions with DOM elements.

Objectives:
Perform exploratory testing to understand the game's rules, mechanics, and outcomes.
Write BDD features in Gherkin with multiple test scenarios.
Use Selenium WebDriver for black-box testing via the DOM.
Analyze the DOM to identify key elements for testing.
Implement and run tests to validate game functionality and identify bugs.
Reflect on Selenium vs. other frameworks like Cypress.io.

How to Run
Install dependencies: npm install
Start the game:       npm start  
Run all tests:        npm test  
Run a specific test:  npx cucumber-js tests/features/NAME_of_FILE.feature
